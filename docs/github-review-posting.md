# GitHub PR review posting

`doomer run` can project findings into GitHub pull request review comments
using **direct HTTP** (REST + GraphQL). It does **not** shell out to `gh`.

## Quick start

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=…   # or GITHUB_TOKEN / ADVERSARY_GITHUB_TOKEN

# Analyze a PR (sets base/head + workspace; does not post)
doomer run https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Plan only (no mutation)
doomer run https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 \
  --github-review --github-dry-run --github-plan-file plan.json

# Create a pending review (default)
doomer run https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --github-review

# Submit as informational COMMENT (visible to authors)
doomer run https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --github-review --github-submit
```

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--github-review` | Opt-in: build plan; post unless dry-run |
| `--github-dry-run` | Plan/place only; never mutate GitHub |
| `--github-plan-file PATH` | Write `CommentPlan` JSON |
| `--github-pr N` | PR number (or use PR URL / Actions env) |
| `--github-repo owner/name` | Repository (or use PR URL / `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`) |
| `--github-submit` | Submit review as `COMMENT` (default leaves **pending**) |
| `--github-resolve-addressed` | Resolve prior Adversary threads whose findings disappear after a complete successful rerun (default `true`) |
| `--github-include-summary=false` | Omit the inferred review basis and persistent aggregate assessment/opinion while retaining finding comments and execution-failure notices |
| `--github-min-severity` | `info`\|`low`\|`medium`\|`high`\|`critical` (default: all) |
| `--github-api-url` | GraphQL endpoint override |
| `--github-rest-url` | REST base override |

Posting is **never** enabled solely because a PR URL was passed.

## Review-posting auth

`doomer run --github-review` resolves an explicit environment token in this
order:

1. `ADVERSARY_GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. `GH_TOKEN`

The review-posting path does not read `gh auth`'s on-disk store. Optionally run
`export GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)` before posting. Catalog training has separate
read-only history authentication described below.

## Comment voice

Use `--github-comment-tone` (`direct`, `neutral`, `coaching`) and
`--github-comment-conciseness` (`terse`, `standard`, `explanatory`) to control
wording independently. `--github-comment-politeness` and
`--github-comment-formality` accept `low`, `medium`, or `high`; politeness also
accepts `very-low` for sharp, evidence-backed criticism of the PR without attacks on its author.
Defaults are `direct`, `terse`, `medium` politeness, and `high` formality;
matching `DOOMER_COMMENT_*` environment variables configure runners, with
flags taking precedence. Low politeness is blunt about code, never personal;
low formality may include occasional mild swearing, never abuse.

When `--github-review` is set, comment bodies use a **product voice**: core rules
and optional example few-shots from the package, applied by LLM rewrite when a
model provider is configured.

Full guide: **[Comment voice](./voice.md)** (layout, train banking, composition).

### Resolve order (first hit wins)

1. **Local adversary package roots** (path args that look like packages), in order:
   - `agent/voice.md` (preferred)
   - `train/voice.md`
   - `voice.md`
   - `VOICE.md` (legacy)
2. **Review target** (`--path`), same relative names
3. Else the **CLI-embedded** default prompt

Example: `doomer run ./torvalds-adversary --path ../app --github-review` loads
`./torvalds-adversary/agent/voice.md` when present.

With **composition** (`uses`), the **CLI entry** package owns rewrite voice—not
each specialist member. See [composition](./composition.md).

Without a model provider configured, a deterministic **template** body is used.
Analysis model flags (`--model-provider` / `--model`) are shared when LLM rewrite
is available.

## Placement

Inline threads require the evidence `file` + `line` to sit on the PR **diff**
(REST PR file patches). Lines not on a hunk are demoted to the review body.
There is no nearest-line guessing.

## Existing PR discussions

Before posting, the CLI reads open GitHub review threads on the PR, including
outdated threads. A finding already covered by an open Doomer thread is carried
forward without another comment. When a human started the matching thread,
Doomer replies there once with its verified finding and suggested fix. Later
runs recognize that reply and stay quiet. Resolved threads are not reused.

Matching requires the same file and a concrete matching defect. Existing
finding IDs and comment text provide strong hints; ambiguous matches use the
configured model. A missing model or uncertain comparison leaves the finding
new. If GitHub thread history cannot be read completely, live posting fails
instead of risking duplicate comments. An unauthenticated dry run cannot check
existing discussions.

The plan file lists `carried` findings and proposed human-thread `replies`
separately from new `comments`. The aggregate review summary covers only new
comments; a run with only carried findings creates no new review. A new commit
between analysis and posting aborts the posting attempt.

## Exit codes

Hard posting failures (auth/network/mutation) map to exit class **4**, even when
findings exist (class 1). Soft placement skips do not change the exit class.

## Incomplete reviews

When review jobs fail, the CLI still posts usable findings, but adds a
**Partial Adversary review** notice naming failed reviewers, their scopes, and
bounded failure diagnostics. This notice also appears when no job returned
findings, and is not disabled by `--github-include-summary=false`. Known provider
and GitHub credentials are redacted; full diagnostics remain in the CI logs.

The notice is host-generated and is never rewritten by the model. Findings keep
normal inline placement and off-diff fallback. A findings-only exit does not
produce a failure notice. Posting a partial review does not turn an execution
failure into success; all-failed compositions retain the underlying error class.

## Content policy

- Visible **findings** only (never observations, positives, or suppressed details)
- Execution failures add an explicit partial-run notice, separate from findings
- Empty plan → no GitHub mutation
- The aggregate summary synthesizes actual findings only; clean adversaries never add review-body noise
- Max 50 inline comments; overflow goes to the review body

## Catalog training authentication

`doomer catalog train` uses the direct GitHub HTTP client. Explicit token
environment variables take precedence; otherwise it uses the active `gh auth`
token. The `gh` CLI is not required when an environment token is configured.
