# CLI releases

For requests to prepare, publish, verify, or recover a CLI release, read and
follow `.agents/skills/doomer-release/SKILL.md` and `docs/release.md`.

Release completion includes GitHub, public downloads, and Homebrew. For stable
releases, it also includes publishing the signed managed release catalog.
Ordinary releases never change the stable bootstrap skill. New stable versions always
use `YYYY.M.D.N`, beginning with `.1` each day. Never modify the user's installed
CLI as part of publishing. Do not commit `scripts/stage-skill-dev.py`.
